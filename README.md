# Crypto Creche
## A Blockchain-Based Solution for Childcare

### Why Childcare?
  * Highly trust based
  * Requires referrals and validation of referrals
  * Involves P2P transfer of value

### Why Crypto?
  * Trustless System
  * Transaction history and digital identity validated on chain
  * Simultaneous transfer of value and validation of transfer


### How does it work?
  * A set number of tokens are allotted to the minter, in this case the community wallet address
  * Minter transfers equal numbers of tokens to members of the community
  * Members of the community exchange tokens for babysitting
  * Job Listings are stored on chain and are viewable by members of the community
  * Parent A can choose to engage in a Job Listing submitted by Parent B
  * Parent B sends tokens to Parent A
